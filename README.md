# VALORANT Spike Countdown

If you're a VALORANT player looking for a handy tool to get better with the timings of planted spikes in your games, look no further than VALORANT Spike Countdown! This lightweight app can be easily opened on your phone or tablet, and allows you to start a countdown timer by simply tapping the screen when a spike is planted.

But that's not all - VALORANT Spike Countdown also alerts you when it's no longer possible to defuse the spike by turning the screen red. This gives you an extra visual cue to help you make split-second decisions in the heat of the game.
